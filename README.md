# Chrome-extension
This is a simple chrome extension. I made this with the help of scrimba leads, they guided me well and it helped will alot.
Its basic function is to save the urls of the websites that you visit in your day to day lives and you are tired of writing the same old link or the sentence on the search bar to go to that websites. This extension will store the links and help you to reach out to them when you need them.
